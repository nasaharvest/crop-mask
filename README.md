# Crop Mask Repository
![workflow](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains code and data to generate annual and in-season crop masks. Two models are trained - a multi-headed pixel wise classifier to classify pixels as containing crop or not, and a multi-spectral satellite image forecaster which forecasts a 12 month timeseries given a partial input:

These can be used to create annual and in season crop maps. 

This repository currently contains the code to do this for Kenya, and Busia county in Kenya:

These maps are available on Google Earth Engine:

* [Kenya (post season)](https://code.earthengine.google.com/ea3613a3a45badfd01ce2ec914dfe1ef)
* [Busia (in season)](https://code.earthengine.google.com/f567cccc28dad7a25e088d56dabfbd4c)

In addition, they are available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4271143).

This model requires data from [Plant Village](https://plantvillage.psu.edu/) and [One Acre Fund](https://oneacrefund.org/). We thank those organizations for making these datasets available to us - please contact them if you are interested in accessing the data.

## Pipeline

The main entrypoints into the pipeline are the [scripts](scripts). Specifically:

* [scripts/export.py](scripts/export.py) exports data (locally, or to Google Drive - see below)
* [scripts/process.py](scripts/process.py) processes the raw data
* [scripts/engineer.py](scripts/engineer.py) combines the earth observation data with the labels to create (x, y) training data
* [scripts/models.py](scripts/model.py) trains the models
* [scripts/predict.py](scripts/predict.py) takes a trained model and runs it on an area

The [split_tiff.py](scripts/split_tiff.py) script is useful to break large exports from Google Earth Engine, which may
be too large to fit into memory.

## Setup

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) running python 3.6 is used as the package manager. To get set up
with an environment, install Anaconda from the link above, and (from this directory) run

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create an environment named `landcover-mapping` with all the necessary packages to run the code. To
activate this environment, run

```bash
conda activate landcover-mapping
```

If you are using a GPU, `environment.gpu.yml` additionally installs `cudatoolkit` so that pytorch can use it too.

#### Earth Engine

Earth engine is used to export data. To use it, once the conda environment has been activated, run

```bash
earthengine authenticate
```

and follow the instructions. To test that everything has worked, run

```bash
python -c "import ee; ee.Initialize()"
```

Note that Earth Engine exports files to Google Drive by default (to the same google account used sign up to Earth Engine).

Running exports can be viewed (and individually cancelled) in the `Tabs` bar on the [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).

Exports from Google Drive should be saved in [`data/raw`](data/raw).

#### Accessing the data
This project uses an AWS S3 bucket to store the training data and `dvc` to manage and fetch the training data. 

To have access to training data:
1. Obtain valid NASAHarvest AWS credentials (access key, secret key)
2. Ensure you have the [AWS cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) on your machine
3. Setup a named profile by running `aws configure` and entering your AWS credentials

To pull the latest training:
1. Ensure you have [dvc](https://dvc.org/doc) installed
2. Run `dvc pull` from the project root directory

#### Tests

The following tests can be run against the pipeline:

```bash
black .  # code formatting
mypy src scripts  # type checking
python -m unittest
```

## Using with docker
#### General Prerequisites
You must have [docker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html) and awscli installed on the machine. If doing inference and using the `--gpus all` the host machine must have accessible GPU drivers and [NVIDIA Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) is setup.

#### Setup - Environment Variables (1 step)
- If you don't have the crop-mask repo, and you aren't sure if you have all the credentials on your machine: simply copy and paste the contents of setup.sh into your shell.
- If you don't have the crop-mask repo, but have all the credential information locally, you can set the environment variables directly
  ```bash
  # Example
  export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
  export AWS_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.aws/credentials
  export CLEARML_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/clearml.conf
  export RCLONE_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
  ```
- If you have the crop-mask repo available just run:
  ```bash
  source setup.sh
  ```
#### Inference (2 steps)
**Step 1:** Specify the following arguments:
- `MODEL_NAME` - model used for inference
- `GDRIVE_DIR` - source of the input files on Google Drive
- `VOLUME` - a directory on the host with a lot of space for storing the inputs and predictions. If using an EC2 instance it is recommended to [mount an EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html) and use its path for this variable

```bash
# Example
export MODEL_NAME="kenya"
export GDRIVE_DIR="remote2:earth_engine_region_rwanda"
export VOLUME="/data"
```

**Step 2:** Begin inference:
```bash
docker run --gpus all \
  -v $CLEARML_CREDENTIALS:/root/clearml.conf \
  -v $RCLONE_CREDENTIALS:/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf \
  --mount type=bind,source=$VOLUME,target=/vol \
  -it ivanzvonkov/cropmask conda run -n landcover-mapping python predict.py \
  --gdrive_path_to_tif_files $GDRIVE_DIR \
  --local_path_to_tif_files /vol/input \
  --split_tif_files true \
  --model_name $MODEL_NAME \
  --predict_dir /vol/predict
```
This command does the following:
1. Gets latest docker image
2. Attaches host GPU to docker image
3. Downloads tif files from Google Drive
4. Splits tif files so they are ready for inference
5. Runs inference on each of the split files
#### Training a new model (2 steps)
**Step 1:** Specify the following arguments:
- `DATASETS` - which datasets to use for trianing
- `MODEL_NAME` - a unique identifier for the resulting model
- `MODELS_DVC_DIR` - a directory on the host machine where the models.dvc file will be exported

```bash
# Example
export DATASETS="geowiki_landcover_2017,kenya_non_crop,one_acre_fund_kenya,plant_village_kenya"
export MODEL_NAME="kenya"
export MODELS_DVC_DIR="$HOME/crop-mask/data"
```

**Step 2:** Begin training:
```bash
docker run \
  -v $AWS_CREDENTIALS:/root/.aws/credentials \
  -v $CLEARML_CREDENTIALS:/root/clearml.conf \
  --mount type=bind,source=$MODELS_DVC_DIR,target=/vol \
  -it ivanzvonkov/cropmask conda run -n landcover-mapping python model.py \
  --datasets $DATASETS \
  --model_name $MODEL_NAME
```
This command does the following:
1. Gets latest docker image
2. Uses the datasets specified to train a model 
3. Logs model training to ClearML
4. Pushes trained model to dvc
5. Outputs the models.dvc file to `$MODELS_DVC_DIR`, this file needs to be git committed inorder to share the trained model with collaborators 

#### Building the docker image locally
```
docker build -t ivanzvonkov/cropmask --secret id=aws,src=$AWS_CREDENTIALS .
```

#### Monitoring Training and Inference
ClearML is used for monitoring training and inference during each docker build. You'll need a ClearML account and access to the ClearML workspace (contact ivan.zvonkov@gmail.com)
