# The given script sends in multiple http requests at a particular time which can be used to test
# the performance of the torchserve deployed on Cloud run or as a standalone docker container.

# For 10 requests, the container CPU utilization reached 32.33% and memory utilization
# reached 34.75%. For 100 concurrent requests, the container CPU utilization reached 82.23% and
#  the container memory utilzation reached 46.15%. For 1000  concurrent requests, the container
# CPU utilization reached 75.39%, and the container memory utilization reached 46.55%.
# More details about additional performance parameters can be found in the 'cloud_run_logs.txt'
