# Measured the performance of pytorch models on a local environment for various batch sizes.
# Varied the batch sizes in factors of 2 from 2 to 1024
# for models: "Namibia_North_2020" and "Malawi_2020_September".The execution time
# on the average was fund to be ~1s. The peak process memory was negligible and
# peak process cpu ranged between 8-70%.
# Additional details can be found in the "local_model_tests.csv".
